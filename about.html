      <h1>About TNT VR Dance Club</h1>
      <p>
        TNT VR Dance Club was founded by Brian in loving memory of our friend Tucker, a passionate dancer both in real life and in VR. 
        Inspired by the joy and energy he shared with everyone around him, the club was created as a space to celebrate his spirit and bring 
        people together through music, movement, and virtual connection.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our goal is to honor Tucker’s legacy by creating a welcoming community where dancers, creators, and VR enthusiasts can share their passion, 
        explore new experiences, and feel the same sense of joy that he brought to all of us.
